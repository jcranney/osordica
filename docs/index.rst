Documentation for the Osordica Project
======================================

The *osordica* is an open source novel instrument designed to run on a Raspberry Pi. The main motivation is to have an electronic synthesiser type handheld instrument which is capable of producing notes/chords across multiple octaves without a player's fingers having to leave the keys.

The osordica combines freedom of design, open sourcedness, and ergonomics in the creation of arguably the worlds worst deliberate instrument.
